Perfect, let’s give it that **“startup-style intro”** vibe 🚀 — short, punchy, and community-inviting. Here’s a refined **GitHub Organization README** for you:

---

# 🌍 Crisis Connect

**We’re building the “Ground News for local crises” — but with community reports, real-time alerts, and AI verification.**

When riots, floods, or accidents break out, information spreads fast — but not always accurately. Crisis Watch helps communities share what’s happening around them, while ensuring misinformation doesn’t put lives at risk.

---

## 🚨 What We Do

* 📝 **User Alerts** – anyone can post about a crisis in their area
* ✅ **Verification Tags** – reports are labeled as *Unverified, Verified, or Trusted Source*
* 📰 **Official Feeds** – local leaders & organizations can share verified updates
* 🧠 **AI Safety Layer** – future deepfake/misinformation detection

---

## 🏗️ How We’re Building It

We’re using **Storyblok (headless CMS)** as our backend:

* It powers all alerts, reports, and moderation.
* It gives us **flexibility** to build apps in any stack (React, React Native, etc.).
* It lets **moderators & partners** manage content without coding.

No heavy backend, just structured data + APIs = faster to build, easier to scale.

## 🎯 Our Mission

> *Real information, when it matters most.*
